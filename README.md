# Random Quote Machine

A web application that displays random quotes. The quotes are fetched from the [Quotable API](https://github.com/lukePeavey/quotable), my sincere thanks to the creator of the API.

This website was created as a part of the [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) Front End Libraries certification. You can check the user stories in the [userstories.md](./userstories.md) file.

## About next.js

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
